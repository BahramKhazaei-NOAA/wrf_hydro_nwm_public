1. Introduction:
The Noah-distributed land-surface-hydrology model
is a physically based 1-dimensional land surface 
model that that has been enhanced to include dynamical
routing processes of overland and subsurface saturated
flow responsible for moving water laterally across 
and through topographically-varying landscapes. Noah-
distributed is based on the 'Unified' Noah model which
is decribed in detail by Ek et al. (2003, JGR).  The
hydrological enhancements to Noah are decribed in 
an NCAR Technical Note by Gochis and Chen (2003). In
the absence of forthcoming articles describing Noah
and Noah-distributed in more detail please refer to
these two works as the primary citations.

This README file provides the basic steps required to
set up and execute Noah-distributed as it is configured
in an offline, or 'uncoupled' mode.  This configuration
has been commonly referred to as the 'land data
assimilation system (LDAS)' mode.  The LDAS under which
Noah-distributed is provided is called the NCAR High
Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS).


2. Contents:
After unpacking the tarfile you will find the 
following under the version directory:
/v4.0/
IO_code/  - directory where much of the model code resides
MPP/      - directory relevant to setting up in parallel mode
Noah_code/ - more model code (mostly utilities and globals)
WRF_code/  - more model code (notably the Noah lsm 'module_sf_noahlsm.F')
Run/       - directory where input tables, primary makefiles,
             namelist and /terrain/ directory reside
Makefiles and macros used for compiling


3. Setting up simple executions:
Model runs that do not involve changes to the model code can
be set up entirely from the /Run/ directory.  From the /Run/
directory there are 4 main steps to executing Noah-distributed:

i) Compiling the model.  This is done by typing 'make' from
the /Run/ directory.  Executing the makefile will search
all subdirectories for new code and compile code that has
not yet been compiled. Successful completion of compilation
will produce a new exectuable entitled 'Noah_wrfdriver_beta'.
Be sure to check the date on this executable to make sure
that you have compiled successfully.  If you experience
problems compiling or if it is your first time compiling 
you might try typing 'make clean' to remove old object files.
So far the Noah-distributed has been successfully compiled 
only on LINUX platforms.

ii) Edit the namelist.  Open and edit 'noah_wrfcode.namelist'
to set up a simulation to your specifications.  The namelist
is fairly well commented.  The directory for input forcing data
must be specified (INDIR), as must the pathway and filename
to the WRFSTATIC file (WRFSI_STATIC_FLNM) and type 
of forcing data (FORC_TYP). Be sure to activate only those
routing switches for which you have the required data. The
subsurface and overland flow routing options require input
of a terrain file'route_topo_f', a stream network 'route_chan_f'
and a land/water mask 'route_lake_f'. Routing timestep 'DTRT'
must be set in accordance with the routing grid spacing in order
to satisfy Courant constraints. Be sure to include the full path
and directory when specifying Routing Input Files.

iii) Create/place routing files in /terrain/ directory.  
As mentioned in (ii) the routing code requires additional
datasets not required for execution of the 1-d Noah model.
These files are created offline, typically in a GIS, and
are placed into the /terrain/ directory.  The number of
files in /terrain/ will depend on the number of Routing
option switches activated.

iv) Execute the model.  Type './Noah_wrfdriver_beta' at the
command line to execute the model.  If run successfully, 
output will be generated as a series of netcdf files with
associated time and date information in the filenames.
