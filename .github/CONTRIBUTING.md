#  Contributing to WRF-Hydro

For intellectual property reasons, we are required to maintain two GitHub repositories: NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm, a private repository containing ongoing development for upcoming versions of the National Water Model, and NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public, a public repository where all community development takes place and public versions of the code are released. In order to keep the private NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm repository up to date with ongoing development in the NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public repository and ensure that these changes can be integrated into the codebase without causing problems we are developing a process to automatically bring changes from the public repository into the NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm repository on a regular basis.  Changes in pull requests to the public repository will need to be tested in the private NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm repository before being merged.
